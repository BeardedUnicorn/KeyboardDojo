## Next Steps

1. Prioritize components based on user impact
2. Implement tests for keyboard components first
3. Create reusable accessibility testing patterns
4. Document accessibility fixes and improvements
5. Integrate accessibility testing into CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Timeline

Based on the comprehensive checklist above, we should implement accessibility testing in the following phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Core keyboard interaction components (KeyboardListener, KeyboardVisualization)
2. **Phase 2 (High Priority)**: Interactive components (Dialogs, Forms, Exercises)
3. **Phase 3 (Medium Priority)**: Navigation and curriculum components
4. **Phase 4 (Ongoing)**: UI components and gamification elements

## Conclusion

This accessibility testing plan covers all Storybook stories in the Keyboard Dojo application. By implementing these tests, we will ensure that our application is accessible to all users, including those who rely on keyboard navigation, screen readers, and other assistive technologies. 

The checklist provides a comprehensive guide for:
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Color contrast and visual accessibility
- Proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML

By adhering to these standards, we will create an inclusive learning experience that benefits all users while complying with accessibility guidelines.
