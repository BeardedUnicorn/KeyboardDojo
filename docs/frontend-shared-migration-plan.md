# Frontend Migration Plan: Using Shared Package

This document outlines the plan for refactoring the frontend codebase to use components, hooks, utilities, and types from the shared package.

## Objectives

1. Update all frontend imports to reference the shared package where applicable
2. Ensure consistent component usage between web and desktop applications
3. Eliminate code duplication between frontend and desktop
4. Maintain functionality and user experience during the migration

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Component Inventory and Analysis

- [ ] Create an inventory of all components moved to the shared package
- [ ] Identify all files in the frontend that import these components
- [ ] Analyze component usage patterns and dependencies
- [ ] Document any frontend-specific customizations that need to be preserved

### 2. Utility and Hook Migration

- [ ] Identify all utility functions and hooks moved to the shared package
- [ ] Map current frontend imports to their shared package equivalents
- [ ] Document any utility functions that need environment-specific behavior
- [ ] Create a migration path for each utility and hook

### 3. Type Definition Updates

- [ ] Identify all type definitions moved to the shared package
- [ ] Update type imports in frontend files
- [ ] Ensure type compatibility between frontend and shared package
- [ ] Document any type extensions needed for frontend-specific features

### 4. Phased Implementation

#### Phase 1: Non-UI Utilities and Types

- [ ] Update imports for utility functions
- [ ] Update imports for type definitions
- [ ] Test basic functionality to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Fix any issues that arise

#### Phase 2: Hooks and Context Providers

- [ ] Update imports for React hooks
- [ ] Update imports for context providers
- [ ] Test component state management
- [ ] Fix any issues that arise

#### Phase 3: UI Components

- [ ] Update imports for basic UI components
- [ ] Update imports for complex components
- [ ] Test component rendering and interactions
- [ ] Fix any issues that arise

#### Phase 4: Page Components

- [ ] Update imports for page-level components
- [ ] Test complete page functionality
- [ ] Fix any issues that arise

### 5. Testing Strategy

- [ ] Unit tests for individual components
- [ ] Integration tests for component interactions
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete user flows
- [ ] Visual regression tests to ensure UI consistency

### 6. Rollback Plan

- [ ] Create snapshots of the codebase before migration
- [ ] Implement feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations
- [ ] Prepare rollback scripts for quick reversion if needed
- [ ] Document the rollback process for the team

## Implementation Details

### Import Pattern Updates

Current pattern:
```typescript
import { Button } from '../components/Button';
import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useAuth';
import { formatDate } from '../utils/dateUtils';
import type { User } from '../types/User';
```

New pattern:
```typescript
import { Button } from '@keyboard-dojo/shared/components';
import { useAuth } from '@keyboard-dojo/shared/hooks';
import { formatDate } from '@keyboard-dojo/shared/utils';
import type { User } from '@keyboard-dojo/shared/types';
```

### Environment-Specific Considerations

For components or utilities that need environment-specific behavior:

```typescript
import { isDesktop } from '@keyboard-dojo/shared/utils';
import { Button } from '@keyboard-dojo/shared/components';

// Environment-specific behavior
const handleClick = () => {
  if (isDesktop()) {
    // Desktop-specific behavior
  } else {
    // Web-specific behavior
  }
};
```

### Component Customization

For components that need frontend-specific customization:

```typescript
import { Button as SharedButton } from '@keyboard-dojo/shared/components';
import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';

// Frontend-specific customization
const Button = styled(SharedButton)(({ theme }) => ({
  // Frontend-specific styles
}));

export default Button;
```

## Migration Checklist

### Preparation

- [ ] Audit shared package to ensure all components are properly exported
- [ ] Update shared package documentation
- [ ] Create test cases for each component to be migrated
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline to test changes

### Execution

- [ ] Update utility and type imports
- [ ] Update hook imports
- [ ] Update UI component imports
- [ ] Update page component imports
- [ ] Run tests and fix issues
- [ ] Update documentation

### Validation

- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Conduct manual testing of key user flows
- [ ] Verify visual consistency
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Validate accessibility

## Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Component inventory and analysis
2. **Week 2**: Utility and hook migration
3. **Week 3**: UI component migration
4. **Week 4**: Page component migration and testing
5. **Week 5**: Bug fixes and documentation

## Resources

- Shared package documentation
- Component inventory
- Frontend codebase structure
- Testing documentation

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Breaking changes in component APIs | High | Medium | Create adapter components or update shared components to maintain compatibility |
| Performance regressions | Medium | Low | Performance testing before and after migration |
| Increased bundle size | Medium | Low | Analyze bundle size and implement code splitting if needed |
| Environment-specific bugs | High | Medium | Thorough testing in both web and desktop environments |
| Developer confusion | Medium | Medium | Clear documentation and team training |

## Success Criteria

- All applicable frontend imports reference the shared package
- All tests pass
- No regression in functionality or user experience
- No significant performance degradation
- Clear documentation for future development
