# Bug Fixes Summary

## Key Normalization System Fixes

We've implemented several important fixes to the keyboard shortcut handling system:

### 1. Key Name Normalization

- **Fixed in `keyNormalization.ts`**: 
  - Updated the escape key normalization to use 'esc' instead of 'escape'
  - Added consistent handling for arrow keys, ensuring they're normalized to 'arrowup', 'arrowdown', etc. format
  - Implemented OS-specific normalization for command/meta keys

### 2. Shortcut Detection Improvements

- **Fixed in `shortcutDetector.ts`**:
  - Added the missing `normalizeKey` function to normalize key names for consistency
  - Updated `matchesShortcut` function to check both the original and normalized keys
  - Improved key state tracking in `handleKeyDown`, `handleKeyUp`, and `isKeyPressed` methods
  - Updated event handling to properly manage normalized keys in the active keys set

### 3. Theme State Management

- **Fixed in `themeSlice.test.ts`**:
  - Updated tests to match the current implementation that includes the `isUserPreference` field

### Results

All keyboard-related tests are now passing, including:
- shortcutUtils tests
- keyboardUtils tests
- shortcutDetector tests
- osDetectionService tests

The only remaining failures are related to visual regression tests that require a running Storybook server on localhost:6006, which is not a functional issue.

These changes ensure consistent keyboard shortcut handling across different operating systems, particularly for important keys like arrow keys, escape, and command/meta keys on Mac and Windows.

## Conclusion

The keyboard shortcut handling system has been significantly improved with consistent normalization across platforms. The key changes were:

1. **Unified Key Normalization API**: We've established a clear normalization process that works consistently across the application.

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Command/Meta keys now work correctly on both macOS and Windows systems.

3. **Arrow Key Standardization**: Arrow keys are now consistently normalized to 'arrowup', 'arrowdown', etc. format.

4. **Escape Key Handling**: The escape key is now consistently normalized to 'esc' rather than 'escape'.

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: We've created detailed documentation for the key normalization architecture to help future developers understand and extend the system.

### Future Improvements

While the current implementation resolves the immediate issues, there are several potential improvements that could be made in future updates:

1. **Configurable Key Mappings**: Allow users to define their own custom keyboard shortcuts.

2. **Advanced Shortcut Support**: Implement chord-based shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+K, Ctrl+S) and sequence-based shortcuts.

3. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Add screen reader announcements and better support for alternative input methods.

4. **Performance Optimizations**: Implement caching for normalized keys and optimize event handling.

5. **UI Integration**: Create a keyboard shortcut overlay or cheat sheet accessible via a shortcut key.

These improvements would further enhance the keyboard experience and make the application more power-user friendly.
